SQL Query for Retrieving Tables
This query can be run to retrieve the list of tables present in a database where the database is “My_Schema”.

With the SELECT command, users can define the columns that they want to get in the query output. This command is also useful to get which column users want to see as the output table. The SELECT statement is applied to pick data from a table. The data retrieved is put in a result table, named the result set. The output data is saved in a result table. This output table is also termed the result set.

SELECT * FROM My_Schema.Tables;

2.   Query for Selecting Columns from a Table
These are perhaps the most useful SQL query examples. In the example below, we are extracting the “Student_ID” column or attribute from the table “STUDENT”. The select statement is used to select data from the database.
